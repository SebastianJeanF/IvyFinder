<p align="center">
IvyFinder is an Android/iOS app that educates nature lovers about poison ivy and other rash-inducing plants natural to the United States. Additionally, IvyFinder can identify for a user if theyâ€™re near poison ivy by using machine learning (ML), specifically object detection. This project was made using Ionic.js, which is a way to turn a JavaScript application into both an Android and iOS mobile app.
